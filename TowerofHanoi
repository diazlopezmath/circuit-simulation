Hello Jos,
Pardon my interruption here. I am a mathematician at Villanova University in USA (https://www1.villanova.edu/villanova/artsci/mathematics/facstaff/biodetail.html?mail=alexander.diaz-lopez@villanova.edu&xsl=bio_long)
Some students of mine did some work related to the Tower of Hanoi and the sequence you added to OEIS (https://oeis.org/A125295).
We would like to contact you via email to ask some questions and make some comments. If you are available, would you mind emailing me (alexander.diaz-lopez@villanova.edu) or sharing your email with me some other way? 

Thanks!
Alexander
